## Features

### Code Execution
- Applied **VM** and **child processes** to securely execute user code and validate its output.
- Implemented a separate worker server to handle heavy tasks, preventing overload on the express server.
- Utilized a worker queue to efficiently manage traffic from the express server.
- Built the worker server with **Bun** instead of Node.js, resulting in a three-fold increase in user capacity.
- Implemented code error detection to notify users of any errors in their code, including excessively large output and potential infinite loops.

### Contest
- Enabled real-time code updates through **Redis pub-sub** and **Socket.IO**.
- Stored game states in the database, providing players and hosts with a seamless experience by allowing them to refresh and reconnect effortlessly.
- The host can watch the progress of every player's contest and interact with them through **Bullet Screen**.

### CICD
- Automated deployment and testing using **GitHub Actions** CI/CD and **Docker** on AWS.

## Load Test

### Identified Critical Area

After conducting load tests on APIs and Socket.IO with K6, a bottleneck was discovered in the process of executing users' code and validating the output.

The original load test for the run code API revealed the following metrics:

- Maximum virtual users: **30**
- Request rate: **6** requests per second

    <img src="https://github.com/shift0965/leetcode-clone/assets/53403797/efb8061f-3a2c-4459-b2df-972039b42442" width="800">
</div>

The bottleneck appears to be occurring specifically during the execution and validation of user code.

### Improvement

To address the bottleneck, several important improvements have been implemented:

1. Bundling Functionality and Using an Independent Server:

   - Separated code execution functionality and hosted on an independent EC2 instance, preventing server blockage and ensuring smoother performance.

2. Implementation of a Worker Queue:

   - Introduced a worker queue to efficiently manage incoming requests. If the queue reaches capacity, users will be advised to run their code later.

3. Utilizing Bun JS for Faster Performance:
   - Switched to Bun from Node.js to significantly improved the execution speed.

</div>

**Load Test Results:**

- Maximum virtual users: **100**
- Request rate: **20**

## End-to-End Game Test

**Selenium Test:**

1. Host login and start a game.
2. Player joins the game and submits a solution.
3. Host observes real-time updates and sends messages.
4. Close the game and verify results.
